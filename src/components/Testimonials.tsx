        fullStory: 'When I first joined Arunya Foundation as a weekend volunteer, I expected to teach basic English and Math. What I didn\'t expect was how much I would learn from the children. Every Saturday morning, their eagerness to learn, their curiosity, and their resilience humbled me.\n\nOne moment stands out — a 7-year-old girl named Kavita, who had never held a pencil before, wrote her name for the first time. The pride in her eyes was something I\'ll carry with me forever.\n\nArunya didn\'t just help me become a better teacher — it helped me become a better human being. The experience strengthened my communication skills, my empathy, and my resolve to create change.',

        fullStory: 'I was a second-year engineering student looking for something meaningful to do on weekends. A friend suggested Arunya Foundation, and I thought I\'d try it for a month.\n\nThat was over a year ago. What keeps me coming back isn\'t just the teaching — it\'s the relationships. The children remember your name, they wait for you, they share their dreams with you.\n\nOne boy, Ravi, told me he wants to become an engineer "just like Rahul bhaiya." That moment redefined my purpose. Now I\'m not just studying engineering — I\'m studying it to be worthy of that child\'s dream.',

        fullStory: 'We live in a small settlement near Gwalior. I work as a domestic helper and my husband is a daily wage laborer. We always wanted our children to study, but we couldn\'t afford tuition or even proper books.\n\nWhen Arunya volunteers started coming to our community, they welcomed my daughter Anita with open arms. Within months, she was reading Hindi stories, solving math problems, and even speaking basic English.\n\nBut the biggest change I noticed was her confidence. She now speaks up, asks questions, and even helps younger children with their studies. As a mother, I feel a deep sense of gratitude that someone believed in my child\'s potential.',

        fullStory: 'My name is Arjun and I am 13 years old. Before I started coming to Arunya Foundation classes, I didn\'t go to school regularly. My parents couldn\'t always afford the fees.\n\nBut at Arunya, everything is free — the books, the classes, even the stationery. The teachers are so kind and they never scold us. They teach us through games and activities.\n\nI have learned so much — I can now count in English, write my name, and even solve multiplication tables. My favorite part is the storytelling session at the end. One day, I want to become a doctor and help my family. Arunya gave me the courage to dream.',

        fullStory: 'I joined Arunya Foundation in its early days. What started as a group of college friends wanting to make a difference has grown into a structured, impactful organization.\n\nAs a volunteer coordinator, I\'ve seen students who couldn\'t write their names become confident readers. I\'ve seen shy children transform into leaders during group discussions.\n\nBut what truly inspires me is our volunteer community. These are young college students giving up their weekends to teach, mentor, and care for children they\'ve never met before. That selflessness is rare and beautiful.\n\nArunya has taught me that change doesn\'t require millions — it requires commitment, consistency, and compassion.',

My biggest fear was that my children would face the same fate.\n\nWhen the Arunya volunteers came to our locality, I was skeptical at first. But they were so patient and caring with the children. My son Deepak, who is 10, now reads Hindi fluently and can even do basic math.\n\nLast month, he helped me count the day\'s earnings correctly. That small moment filled me with so much pride. I may not be educated, but because of Arunya, my son will be.\n\nI pray this foundation continues to shine its light on children like mine.',
